= Submarine Swaps

Submarine swaps allows us to convert on-chain to off-chain funds and vice versa. They are based on a specific type of Bitcoin smart contract called Hash Time Locked Contracts, HTLCs for short. HTLCs can be included in both, on-chain and off-chain, transactions. In fact, they can be used to chain payments and is the main construct that enables money transfer over the Lightning Network. HTLCs can also be leveraged between an on-chain sender and an off-chain receiver, and vice versa, and these are submarine swaps. The submarine swap smart contract is called a _swap provider_. It can be managed by a third party service, but fundamentally it is just a smart contract on the blockchain. +

With this technique we can

* trustlessly pay a swap provider in one network to perform a payment onto the other network
* trustlessly pay a swap provider in one network to get coins onto the other network
* trustlessly pay a swap provider to rebalance our lightning channels

In the following tutorials we will build the swap smart contract with BitcoinJS and imagine the first use case, sending funds to the _swap provider_ on one network so that he performs a payment to a merchant on the other network.
