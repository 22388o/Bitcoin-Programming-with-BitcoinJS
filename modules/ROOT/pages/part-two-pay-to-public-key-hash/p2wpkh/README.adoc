= Native Segwit P2WPKH

P2WPKH is the native Segwit version of a Pay to Public Key hash.

The scripts and script data are spread out as follows

----
witness:      SIGNATURE PUBKEY
scriptSig:    empty
Previous output scriptPubKey: 0 20-BYTE-KEY-HASH
----

Each Bitcoin full node will parse the `scriptPubKey` and check the witness program size. If it is 20 bytes long, it is interpreted as a P2WPKH program.

Then each validating node checks that:

* the witness stack is `&lt;sig&gt;` + `&lt;pubKey&gt;`
* the HASH160 of the public key match the 20-byte witness program
* verify the signature against the public key with the CHECKSIG operation

Comparing with a traditional P2PKH output, the P2WPKH equivalent occupies 3 less bytes in the scriptPubKey, and moves the signature and
public key from the scriptSig to the witness data stack.
