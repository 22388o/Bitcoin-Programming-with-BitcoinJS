= Number Encoding

Numbers in Bitcoin script require to be encoded in little endian hexadecimal.
BitcoinJS takes care of that, but in case you need it there is a bash script for that, link:../code/tools/int2lehex.sh[int2lehex.sh].

Instructions:

 $ cd code/tools
 $ int2lehex.sh 42
 Integer: 42
 LE Hex: 2a
 Length: 1 bytes
 Hexcode: 012a

If you have a `permission denied` error, run:

 chmod 755 int2lehex.sh
