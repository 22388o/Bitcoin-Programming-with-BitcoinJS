= Bitcoin Programming with BitcoinJS, Bitcoin Core and LND

Welcome to the non-official _Bitcoin Programming with BitcoinJS_ extensive guide! You will learn how to create various types of Bitcoin transactions using the version 4 of https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib[BitcoinJS] library.

We will use the Bitcoin Core command-line interface in Regtest mode for various common tasks, as well as some complementary libraries like `bx` aka https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer[Libbitcoin Explorer].

Throughout this guide, we want to provide you with sufficient explanation to each command to understand it without drowning in information. You can refer to additional resources to better understand the Bitcoin protocol. For example, check out our https://www.bitcoin-studio.com/resources[Bitcoin Studio presentations].

At the moment, Bitcoin Javascript tutorials are still very scarce, but we believe it doesn't have to be this way. The following guide intends to address this problem.

This guide is maintained on https://github.com/bitcoin-studio/Bitcoin-Programming-with-BitcoinJS[GitHub] and available as a https://bitcoinjs-guide.bitcoin-studio.com[GitBook]

== Requirements

Having prior theoretical knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol will surely help, but we provide comprehensive explanation throughout this guide so it fits for beginners.

Technical requirements

* Node v10 recommended
* BitcoinJS v4
* Bitcoin Core v18
* Bash or a Bash interpreter like Cygwin or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
* JQ (json parser)
* Libbitcoin Explorer v3 (optional)
